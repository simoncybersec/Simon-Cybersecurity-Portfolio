Controls and Compliance Assessment
Case Study
This is based on a fictional company:
GreenLeaf Organics is a mid-sized organic food retailer based in Canada. The company operates both physical stores and an e-commerce platform, selling organic produce, packaged foods, and eco-friendly products. With the rapid growth of their online sales, GreenLeaf Organics has expanded its customer base to include international buyers, particularly from the European Union (E.U.) and the United States. However, this growth has exposed the company to new cybersecurity risks and compliance challenges.
The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has initiated an internal IT audit to assess the company’s security posture and ensure compliance with relevant regulations. The CISO is particularly concerned about the security of customer data, payment processing systems, and adherence to international data protection laws. The goal of the audit is to identify gaps in controls, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance with standards such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

Scenario
GreenLeaf Organics: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

E-commerce platform and payment processing systems
Customer data storage and management
Employee access controls and endpoint security
Compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS, and other relevant regulations
Goals
Assess the current state of IT controls and compliance practices.
Identify risks and vulnerabilities in the company’s security posture.

Risk Assessment
Risk Description:
GreenLeaf Organics lacks adequate controls for securing customer data and payment systems. Additionally, the company may not be fully compliant with GDPR and PCI DSS requirements, exposing it to potential fines and reputational damage.
Control Best Practices:
The company should implement the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from cybersecurity threats. Key focus areas include:
Implementing least privilege access for employees
Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit
Establishing a disaster recovery plan and regular backups
Conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
Risk Score:
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 7.5, indicating a significant risk due to inadequate controls and compliance gaps.
Additional Comments:
The potential impact of a data breach or compliance violation is high, given the sensitive nature of customer data and the company’s international operations.
